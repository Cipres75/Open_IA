<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A sequential design utilizing identical samples was used to classify mixed methods studies via a twodimensional model, wherein sampling designs were grouped according to the time orientation of each study's components and the relationship of the qualitative and quantitative samples. A quantitative analysis of 121 studies representing nine elds in the social or health sciences revealed that more studies utilized a sampling design that was concurrent (66.1%) than sequential (33.9%). Also, identical sampling designs were the most prevalent, followed by nested sampling, multilevel sampling, and parallel sampling, respectively. Qualitative analysis suggested that across a number of studies the researchers made statistical generalizations that were not sufciently warranted-culminating in interpretive inconsistency and contributing to crises of representation, legitimation, integration, and politics.</p></div>

The popularization of mixed methods research has led to an increase in the number of publications devoted to methodological issues in this eld-the most comprehensive of which, to date, has been the Handbook of Mixed Methods in Social &amp; Behavioral Research <ref type="bibr" coords="3,117,18,204,55,157,71,11,61">(Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003a)</ref>, which has provided researchers with some theoretical and practical tools for conducting mixed methods research. Nevertheless, as noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,83,35,234,86,160,89,11,61" target="#b80">Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003)</ref>, six unresolved issues and controversies in the use of mixed methods in the social and behavioral sciences still prevail, namely, (a) the nomenclature and basic denitions used in mixed methods research, (b) the utility of mixed methods research, (c) the paradigmatic underpinning for mixed methods research, (d) design issues in mixed methods research, (e) issues in making inferences in mixed methods research, and (f) the logistics of conducting mixed methods research. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,66,16,325,85,108,69,11,61" target="#b54">Onwuegbuzie (2007)</ref> has identied the following four crises or challenges that researchers face when undertaking mixed methods research: representation, legitimation, integration, and politics. Each of these challenges, which incorporates one or more of Teddlie and Tashakkori's six unresolved issues, is discussed in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Four Challenges in Mixed Methods Research</head><p>The challenge of representation refers to the fact that sampling problems characterize both quantitative and qualitative research. With respect to quantitative research, the majority of studies utilize sample sizes that are too small to detect statistically signicant differences or relationships (i.e., statistical power typically ranging from .4 to .6, with an average statistical power of .5; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,183,59,507,67,62,74,11,61" target="#b8">Cohen, 1962</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,255,44,507,67,22,96,11,61" target="#b9">Cohen, , 1965</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,287,49,507,67,22,96,11,61" target="#b10">Cohen, , 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,319,54,507,67,28,95,11,61" target="#b10">Cohen, , 1992;;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,351,97,507,67,78,04,11,61" target="#b67">Schmidt, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,433,50,507,67,97,80,11,61;3,66,16,522,79,28,95,11,61" target="#b68">Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,98,93,522,79,165,13,11,61" target="#b69">Schmidt, Hunter, &amp; Urry, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,267,82,522,79,162,29,11,61" target="#b71">Sedlmeier &amp; Gigerenzer, 1989)</ref> and utilize nonrandom samples that prevent effect-size estimates from being generalized to the underlying population <ref type="bibr" coords="3,124,41,553,12,193,27,11,61" target="#b57">(Onwuegbuzie, Jiao, &amp; Bostick 2004)</ref>. In qualitative research, the challenge of representation refers to the difculties researchers encounter in capturing lived experiences via their social texts <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174,36,583,45,132,70,11,61" target="#b21">(Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005)</ref>. In mixed methods research, the challenge of representation often is intensied because both the qualitative and quantitative components of studies bring to the study their own unique challenges. In mixed methods studies, the challenge of representation refers to the difculty in capturing (i.e., representing) the lived experience using text in general and words and numbers in particular.</p><p>The second challenge in mixed methods research pertains to legitimation or validity. With respect to quantitative research, the importance of legitimation, or what is more commonly referred to as ''validity,'' has been long acknowledged and is well documented in the literature, including measurement-related validity (e.g., construct-related validity, criterion-related validity, content-related validity) and design-related validity (e.g., internal validity, external validity; American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, &amp; National Council on Measurement in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,440,42,750,23,90,95,11,61">Education, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,64,50,88,83,119,09,11,61" target="#b3">Bracht &amp; Glass, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,188,17,88,83,87,10,11,61" target="#b4">Campbell, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,279,85,88,83,144,96,11,61" target="#b5">Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,429,38,88,83,100,29,11,61;4,64,50,103,95,29,25,11,61" target="#b14">Cook &amp; Campbell, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,98,66,103,95,73,97,11,61" target="#b44">Messick, 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,183,32,103,95,29,25,11,61" target="#b45">Messick, , 1995;;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,217,48,103,95,187,02,11,61" target="#b72">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,409,42,103,95,114,77,11,61" target="#b75">Smith &amp; Glass, 1987)</ref>. With respect to the qualitative research paradigm, the issue of legitimation has been more controversial. However, some prominent qualitative researchers argue for ''a serious rethinking of such terms as validity, generalizability, and reliability, terms already retheorized in postpositivist . . . , constructivist-naturalistic, feminist . . . , interpretive . . . , poststructural . . . , and critical . . . discourses'' <ref type="bibr" coords="4,309,51,179,71,169,54,11,61">(Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005, p. 17)</ref> and have reconceptualized traditional validity in ways such as the following: credibility (replacement for quantitative concept of internal validity), transferability (replacement for quantitative concept of external validity), dependability (replacement for quantitative concept of reliability), and conrmability (replacement for quantitative concept of objectivity; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,64,50,255,55,121,15,11,61" target="#b41">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985)</ref>. As is the case for the challenge of representation, the challenge of legitimation is greater in mixed methods studies than in monomethod studies (i.e., quantitative research or qualitative alone). The challenge of legitimation refers to the difculty in obtaining ndings and/or making inferences that are credible, trustworthy, dependable, transferable, and/or conrmable <ref type="bibr" coords="4,297,17,316,15,167,85,11,61" target="#b58">(Onwuegbuzie &amp; Johnson, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The third challenge in mixed methods research pertains to integration. This challenge compels mixed methods researchers to ask questions such as the following: Is it appropriate to triangulate, expand, compare, or consolidate quantitative data originating from a large, random sample with qualitative data arising from a small, purposive sample? How much weight should researchers and/or consumers place on qualitative data compared to quantitative data?</p><p>The fourth challenge in mixed methods research is the challenge of politics. This challenge refers to the tensions that come to the fore as a result of combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. These tensions include any conicts that occur when different investigators are used for the qualitative and quantitative components of an investigation, as well as the contradictions and paradoxes that come to the fore when qualitative and quantitative data are compared and contrasted. The challenge of politics also pertains to the difculty in persuading the consumers of mixed methods research, including stakeholders and policy makers, to value the ndings stemming from both the qualitative and quantitative phases of a study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Addressing the Four Challenges in Mixed Methods Research</head><p>For mixed methods research to maximize its credibility as a paradigm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,451,64,619,25,73,04,11,61;4,64,51,634,45,298,20,11,61">(i.e., investigation validity, communicative validity, and action validity;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,366,09,634,45,64,95,11,61">Kvale, 1995)</ref>, it is essential that these four challenges be addressed. Of the 13 steps in the mixed methods research process identied by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,137,08,664,78,221,20,11,61" target="#b12">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Sutton (2006)</ref>, 1 we believe that selecting the sampling design, which comprises making decisions about the sampling scheme(s) and sample size(s), is a pivotal step for addressing simultaneously these four challenges. In particular, as noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,199,18,710,20,195,42,11,61">Onwuegbuzie and Collins (in press</ref>), representation can be improved by ensuring that sampling decisions stem from (a) the research goal (predict; add to the knowledge base; have a personal, social, institutional, and/or organizational impact; measure change; understand complex phenomena; test new ideas; generate new ideas; inform constituencies; or examine the past <ref type="bibr" coords="5,346,71,88,83,184,64,11,61;5,66,16,103,95,81,07,11,61" target="#b52">[Newman, Ridenour, Newman, &amp; DeMarco, 2003]</ref>), (b) research objective (i.e., exploration, description, explanation, prediction, or inuence <ref type="bibr" coords="5,158,78,119,15,157,63,11,61" target="#b33">[Johnson &amp; Christensen, 2004]</ref>), (c) rationale of the study and rationale for mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches (i.e., participant enrichment, instrument delity, treatment integrity, and signicance enhancement <ref type="bibr" coords="5,370,23,149,47,155,73,11,61;5,66,16,164,59,50,37,11,61" target="#b12">[Collins, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Sutton, 2006]</ref>), (d) purpose of the study and purpose for mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches (e.g., recruit participants, assess the appropriateness and/or utility of existing instrument(s); assess delity of intervention; augment interpretation of ndings <ref type="bibr" coords="5,487,21,194,91,44,08,11,61;5,66,16,210,03,156,84,11,61" target="#b12">[Collins, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Sutton, 2006]</ref>), and (e) research question(s). For example, with respect to the research goal, the goal of predicting as opposed to understanding complex phenomena likely will lead to a different research objective (i.e., prediction vs. exploration, description, or explanation), rationale (e.g., instrument delity vs. participant enrichment), research purpose (e.g., triangulation vs. expansion), and research questions-thereby culminating in different sampling designs, sampling schemes, and sample sizes that yield more rigorous research studies. Representation also can be enhanced by ensuring that the sample selected for each component of the mixed methods study is compatible with the research design.</p><p>Furthermore, the samples that are selected for the qualitative and quantitative components should (a) generate adequate data pertaining to the phenomenon of interest under study-these data allow thick, rich description that increases descriptive validity and interpretive validity <ref type="bibr" coords="5,175,17,376,81,86,19,11,61" target="#b43">(Maxwell, 1992)</ref>; (b) help the researcher to obtain data saturation, theoretical saturation, and/or informational redundancy <ref type="bibr" coords="5,365,03,392,01,68,66,11,61" target="#b24">(Flick, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,439,21,392,01,92,14,11,61;5,66,16,407,14,29,25,11,61" target="#b41">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,98,67,407,14,68,39,11,61" target="#b51">Morse, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,170,32,407,14,123,54,11,61" target="#b76">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990)</ref>; and (c) allow the researcher to make statistical and/or analytical generalizations. In other words, the sampling design should allow mixed methods researchers to make generalizations to other participants, populations, settings, locations, contexts, events, incidents, activities, experiences, times, and/or processes-such that it facilitates internal and/or external generalizations <ref type="bibr" coords="5,478,22,467,80,53,12,11,61;5,66,16,482,93,27,60,11,61" target="#b43">(Maxwell, 1992)</ref>. In the context of a mixed methods design, the researcher may purposively extend the conclusions based on the quantitative and qualitative components to the group or context studied (i.e., internal generalizations) or extend the conclusions to another context or group of individuals who are representative of the study's sample (i.e., external or crosspopulation generalizations) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,209,73,543,57,68,33,11,61" target="#b30">(Hood, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,281,25,543,57,81,27,11,61" target="#b43">Maxwell, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,365,71,543,57,158,82,11,61" target="#b60">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Leech, 2005a)</ref>.</p><p>Legitimation can be enhanced by ensuring that inferences stem directly from the underlying sample of units <ref type="bibr" coords="5,181,40,573,88,225,49,11,61" target="#b18">(Curtis, Gesler, Smith, &amp; Washburn, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,411,01,573,88,120,35,11,61;5,66,16,589,08,75,69,11,61" target="#b36">Kemper, Stringeld, &amp; Teddlie, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,145,63,589,08,137,39,11,61" target="#b47">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,286,87,589,08,171,06,11,61">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Collins, in press</ref>). In addition, an appropriate sampling design also can increase theoretical validity <ref type="bibr" coords="5,439,81,604,20,86,06,11,61" target="#b43">(Maxwell, 1992)</ref>. Also, the sampling design can enhance legitimation by incorporating audit trails <ref type="bibr" coords="5,482,46,619,32,48,85,11,61;5,66,16,634,52,29,25,11,61" target="#b28">(Halpern, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,98,60,634,52,118,17,11,61" target="#b41">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>The challenge of integration can be reduced by utilizing sampling designs that help researchers to make meta-inferences (i.e., both sets of inferences are combined into a coherent whole; <ref type="bibr" coords="5,121,83,679,95,147,96,11,61" target="#b79">Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003b)</ref> that adequately represent the quantitative and qualitative ndings and allow the appropriate emphasis to be placed. Finally, the challenge of politics can be decreased by employing sampling designs that are realistic (i.e., leads to an accurate account of the phenomenon), efcient (i.e., can be undertaken using the available resources), practical (i.e., compatible with the researcher's competencies, experiences, interests, and work style; within the scope of the potential sample members), and ethical (i.e., adheres to the ethical guidelines stipulated by organizations such as institutional review boards to ensure that the integrity of the study is maintained throughout and that all sample members are protected).</p><p>Thus, as can be seen, choice of sampling designs is a vital step in the mixed methods research process. Thus, it is somewhat surprising that the issue of sampling was not included as one of <ref type="bibr" coords="6,163,84,149,47,170,40,11,61" target="#b80">Teddlie and Tashakkori's (2003)</ref> six issues of concern in mixed methods research. It is even more surprising that a comprehensive review of the literature revealed that, to date, only four articles were identied that deal specically with the topic of sampling within a mixed methods framework (i.e., <ref type="bibr" coords="6,363,30,194,91,166,41,11,61;6,64,51,210,03,29,25,11,61" target="#b11">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Jiao, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,96,96,210,03,105,28,11,61" target="#b36">Kemper et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,205,43,210,03,174,25,11,61">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Collins, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,382,88,210,03,105,36,11,61" target="#b81">Teddlie &amp; Yu, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling Designs</head><p>As noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="6,143,71,277,71,183,06,11,61">Onwuegbuzie and Collins (in press)</ref>, sampling designs comprise two major components: the sampling scheme and the sample size. The sampling scheme denotes the explicit strategies used to select units (e.g., people, groups, settings, and events), whereas the sample size indicates the number of units selected for the study. In mixed methods studies, the researcher must make sampling scheme and sample size considerations for both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study. Thus, mixed methods sampling designs represent the framework within which the sampling occurs, including the number and types of sampling schemes, as well as the sample size.</p><p>Sampling schemes.

More specically, statistical generalizability refers to representativeness, whereas analytic generalizability and case-to-case transfer relate to conceptual power <ref type="bibr" coords="8,162,62,527,49,144,04,11,61" target="#b47">(Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994)</ref>. Sampling designs play a pivotal role in determining the type of generalizations that is justiable. In particular, whereas large and random samples tend to allow statistical generalizations, small and purposive samples tend to facilitate analytical generalizations and case-to-case transfers. As such, quantitative researchers tend to make statistical generalizations, whereas qualitative researchers tend to make either analytic generalizations or case-to-case transfers. However, in mixed methods research, because quantitative and qualitative research approaches are combined, making appropriate generalizations become even more complex. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,78,49,648,75,208,26,11,61" target="#b11">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao (2006)</ref> coined the phrase interpretive consistency to denote the consistency between the inferences made by the researcher(s) and the sampling design (e.g., sampling scheme, sample size) used. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,372,54,679,08,6,41,11,61" target="#fig_0">1</ref> provides a two-dimensional representation that indicates sampling designs that can yield statistical generalizations with interpretive consistency. In this gure, it can be seen that statistical generalizations typically represent interpretive consistency when both sets of quantitative and qualitative samples are large and, preferably, random-that is, when both sets of samples are representative of the population to which the meta-inferences are being made.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Framework for Mixed Methods Sampling Designs</head><p>Onwuegbuzie and Collins (in press) have provided a useful framework for helping mixed methods researchers identify rigorous sampling designs as well as classify mixed methods studies in the extant literature with respect to their sampling strategies. This framework incorporates a two-dimensional mixed methods sampling model. Specically, this model provides a typology in which mixed methods sampling designs can be categorized according to (a) the time orientation of the components and (b) the relationship of the qualitative and quantitative samples. Time orientation refers to whether the qualitative and quantitative phases occur sequentially or concurrently. A sequential sampling design involves the qualitative phase rst being conducted to inform the subsequent quantitative phase, or vice versa. That is, a sequential sampling design involves some or all of the ndings stemming from the sample selected for one phase being needed to drive the second phase and, subsequently, the sample pertaining to this phase. Conversely, when a concurrent sampling design is utilized, data stemming from the sample selected for one phase do not inform the data stemming from the sample selected for the other phase. However, data obtained from both samples are integrated and interpreted at the data interpretation stage.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" coords="11,150,47,708,25,177,16,11,61">Onwuegbuzie and Collins (in press</ref>), the relationship of the qualitative and quantitative samples either can be identical, parallel, nested, or multilevel. An identical relationship indicates that exactly the same sample members participate in both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study. In contrast, a parallel relationship denotes that the samples for the qualitative and quantitative components of the investigation are different but are drawn from the same underlying population (e.g., elementary school students from one school in one phase and elementary school students from another school for the other phase). A nested relationship implies that the sample members selected for one component of the inquiry represent a subset of those participants chosen for the other phase of the study. Finally, a multilevel relationship involves the use of two or more sets of samples that are obtained from different levels of the investigation (i.e., different populations). For example, whereas one phase of the study (e.g., quantitative phase) might involve the sampling of students within a high school, the other phase (e.g., qualitative) might involve the sampling of their teachers, guidance counselors, principal, and/or parents.</p><p>The two criteria, namely, time orientation and sample relationship, yield eight unique sample designs that typify the various ways that the quantitative and qualitative samples are selected by mixed methods researchers. 5 Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,338,56,270,68,6,41,11,61" target="#fig_2">3</ref> provides a visual representation of this two-dimensional mixed methods sampling model developed by <ref type="bibr" coords="12,434,30,285,88,95,39,11,61;12,64,50,301,01,87,20,11,61">Onwuegbuzie and Collins (in press</ref>).

Their qualitative analysis suggested a degree of interpretive inconsistency in many studies. In particular, regardless of the size of the sample or of the discrepancy between the size of the samples in the quantitative and qualitative phases, the majority of researchers made meta-inferences. Yet in several instances, making such meta-inferences was not sufciently justied-resulting in interpretive inconsistency.</p><p>However, it is not clear how statistically generalizable <ref type="bibr" coords="14,384,20,740,62,145,47,11,61;14,64,51,755,82,68,96,11,61" target="#b11">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao's (2006)</ref> ndings are because they involved mixed methods studies from only one discipline-school psychology. Also, in none of the 42 studies did the researcher(s) explicitly label the study as representing mixed methods research. By not framing their studies in this way, the school psychology researchers likely were not maximizing the extent to which they utilized mixed methodologies. As such, their mixed methods designs were not optimized. Thus, replications of Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao's study are needed to address the challenges of representation, legitimation, integration, and politics associated with Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao's results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose of the Current Study</head><p>With this in mind, the purpose of the current mixed methods research was to replicate and extend <ref type="bibr" coords="15,129,39,270,68,218,24,11,61" target="#b11">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao's (2006)</ref> study. Specically, in the present inquiry, we investigated the prevalence of sampling designs utilized in mixed methods research. In addition, we examined interpretive consistency among these articles. This study represented an extension because it not only involved an examination of a larger sample of mixed methods research articles, but it also involved an examination of studies published in journals representing numerous elds (e.g., psychology, sociology, education, business, nursing). In addition, this investigation utilized studies that were more intentionally mixed methods in nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study was mixed methods in nature because it utilized both quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyze sampling designs used in mixed methods studies in a multitude of elds. To assess the prevalence rates of the eight mixed methods sampling designs conceptualized by <ref type="bibr" coords="15,163,30,498,03,179,44,11,61">Onwuegbuzie and Collins (in press</ref>), we conducted an extensive search utilizing the entire population of electronic bibliographic records of all available elds of social and health sciences at the time of the study. Specically, 15 electronic bibliographic databases that represent the most widely used electronic sources in the elds of social and health sciences were identied: ABI/Inform Global (ProQuest), Academic Search Premier (EBSCOHost), Business Source Premier (EBSCOHost), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), Education Full-Text (WilsonWeb), ERIC (EBSCOHost), Health Reference Center (Gale InfoTrac), Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition (EBSCOHost), PsycARTICLES (EBSCOHost), PsycINFO (EBSCOHost), EconLit (EBSCOHost), Education: A SAGE Full-Text Collection (CSA Illumina), Sociological Abstracts (CSA Illumina), Social Services Abstracts (CSA Illumina), and PAIS International (SilverPlatter).</p><p>To identify mixed method research articles, the following two keyword search terms were used: mixed method and mixed methodology. Our rationale for using these keywords was that they would yield articles that were likely to be the most focused with respect to utilizing mixed methods research approaches. Indeed, an examination of the nal pool of selected articles supported this prediction because most of these articles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,485,81,725,44,45,58,11,61;15,66,16,740,57,107,01,11,61" target="#b19">Daley &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,176,37,740,57,72,05,11,61" target="#b31">Hurley, 2001)</ref> contained one or more citations of the most prominent methodological works in the eld of mixed methods research such as <ref type="bibr" coords="15,459,87,755,77,71,50,11,61;16,64,50,88,83,72,66,11,61" target="#b6">Caracelli and Greene (1993)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" coords="16,145,77,88,83,195,20,11,61" target="#b27">Greene, Caracelli, and Graham (1989)</ref>; and <ref type="bibr" coords="16,371,28,88,83,79,53,11,61">Tashakkori and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,454,01,88,83,75,72,11,61;16,64,50,103,95,33,31,11,61">Teddlie (1998, 2003a)</ref>.</p><p>For each database, we examined all the years for which records existed.

After eliminating the 207 articles that appeared in more than one database (i.e., duplicate records), 496 articles remained. 6  A second screening was conducted based on the list of 496 articles. The abstracts of all these articles were scrutinized for relevance. After eliminating the hidden duplicate records of articles, book reviews, ERIC documents, doctoral dissertations, and pure methodological articles (i.e., nonempirical articles), 128 potentially relevant articles were identied.</p><p>Copies of these 128 articles were obtained through either the electronic databases or interlibrary loan services. These articles were then read in their entirety to determine whether they met our inclusion criteria: (a) empirical article that used mixed methods techniques and (b) published in a peer-reviewed English-language journal. 7 Another 7 articles that did not t these inclusion criteria were eliminated, 8 resulting in a nal sample of 121 mixed methods research articles.</p><p>We utilized a sequential design using identical samples (Design 5) to conduct our investigation. In this sampling design, the quantitative phase preceded the qualitative phase such that the quantitative phase informed the qualitative phase. For the quantitative phase of our study, the 121 articles were classied using Onwuegbuzie and Collins's (in press) two-dimensional mixed methods sampling model. The frequency rates then were compared and contrasted with respect to (a) the eight mixed methods sampling designs, (b) the time orientation of the components (i.e., concurrent vs. sequential), and (c) the relationship of the qualitative and quantitative samples (i.e., identical vs. parallel vs. nested vs. multilevel). Interrater reliability-a form of double coding <ref type="bibr" coords="16,422,42,452,61,107,29,11,61;16,64,49,467,75,34,79,11,61" target="#b47">(Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994)</ref>-was used as a means of assessing the validity of the categorizations made. Thus, the verication component of categorization was empirical in nature <ref type="bibr" coords="16,418,90,482,88,78,68,11,61" target="#b13">(Constas, 1992)</ref>. Spe-cically, two of the researchers independently coded each study by classifying the underlying sampling design into one of the eight mixed methods sampling designs that comprise Onwuegbuzie and Collins's (in press) typology. Kappa's index was used to assess the interrater reliability of the two sets of classications. This index measures the degree to which observers achieve the possible agreement over and above any agreement than can be expected to occur by chance alone <ref type="bibr" coords="16,310,15,573,87,72,18,11,61" target="#b7">(Cohen, 1960)</ref>. Because interrater reliability represents a quantitative technique, as well as being empirical, the verication component of categorization was technical and was accomplished a posteriori <ref type="bibr" coords="16,444,27,604,20,79,95,11,61" target="#b13">(Constas, 1992)</ref>. The following criteria were used to interpret the Kappa coefcient: &lt; .20 = poor agreement, .21-.40 = fair agreement, .41-.60 = moderate agreement, .61-.80 = good agreement, .81-1.00 = very good agreement <ref type="bibr" coords="16,278,33,649,66,77,95,11,61" target="#b0">(Altman, 1991)</ref>. For our inquiry, Kappa's index was .98 (SE = .014), which suggested extremely good agreement between the two raters.</p><p>The qualitative phase involved a within-case analysis for each mixed methods study to examine further the time orientation of the quantitative and qualitative components and the relationship between the quantitative and qualitative samples. This analysis involved evaluating the sample size and sampling scheme used for both the qualitative and quantitative components of each mixed methods study. Furthermore, the underlying mixed methods sampling design, sample sizes, and sampling schemes were compared and contrasted with the interpretations, recommendations, conclusions, and meta-inferences made in the discussion section of the article. In particular, an effects matrix <ref type="bibr" coords="17,366,35,103,95,140,93,11,61" target="#b47">(Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994)</ref> was used to determine the extent to which the researchers' interpretations, inferences, and/or conclusions were consistent with the overall mixed methods sampling design used (i.e., interpretive consistency). According to <ref type="bibr" coords="17,235,02,149,47,147,44,11,61" target="#b47">Miles and Huberman (1994)</ref>, effects matrices are useful when there are ''ultimate'' outcomes and ''effects'' (p. 137). In the present investigation, the interpretations, conclusions, meta-inferences, and recommendations that were made by the researchers represented the ultimate outcomes. The research question, sample size, sampling scheme, mixed methods sampling design, mixed methods research design, and data analysis techniques primarily represented the effects. As such, this effects matrix allowed us, for each study, to compare directly these effects to the ultimate outcomes. Moreover, this series of matrices facilitated an examination of the extent to which interpretive consistency prevailed among these 121 articles. Excel spreadsheets were used to create these effects matrices, wherein the cell entries in these effect matrices contained either verbatim statements made by the author(s) of the article under examination or our own brief eld notes. Consequently, these effects matrices yielded an audit trail (i.e., address the challenge of legitimation), which many qualitative researchers recommended as a method of evaluating legitimation, enhancing legitimation, or both <ref type="bibr" coords="17,200,83,346,48,80,01,11,61" target="#b28">(Halpern, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,285,12,346,48,120,31,11,61" target="#b41">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,409,73,346,48,121,64,11,61;17,66,16,361,68,26,78,11,61" target="#b59">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Leech, 2004)</ref>.

Specically, data reduction involves reducing the dimensionality of the qualitative data (e.g., via exploratory thematic analysis, memoing) and quantitative data (e.g., via descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, multiple dimensional scaling, cluster analysis). Data display, the second stage, represents describing visually the qualitative data (e.g., matrices, charts, graphs, lists, networks, rubrics, maps, and Venn diagrams) and quantitative data (e.g., tables, graphs). The third stage is the data transformation stage, whereby qualitative data are converted into numerical codes that can be analyzed statistically (i.e., quantitized; <ref type="bibr" coords="17,132,56,543,57,155,43,11,61" target="#b77">Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 1998)</ref> and/or quantitative data are transformed into narrative data that can be represented qualitatively (i.e., qualitized; <ref type="bibr" coords="17,414,40,558,76,116,95,11,61;17,66,16,573,88,27,60,11,61" target="#b77">Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 1998)</ref>. Data correlation, the fourth stage, involves qualitative data being correlated with quantitized data and/or quantitative data being correlated with qualitized data. The fth stage is data consolidation, whereby both qualitative and quantitative data are combined to create new or consolidated variables. The sixth stage, data comparison, involves comparing and contrasting data from the qualitative and quantitative data sources. Data integration, the seventh and nal stage, represents quantitative and qualitative data being integrated into either a coherent whole or two separate sets (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) of coherent wholes. In evaluating the interpretive consistency used in the 121 mixed methods investigations, the data consolidation stage was not used. This was because the quantitative and qualitative data were not combined to develop unique or consolidated variables. However, the remaining six stages of <ref type="bibr" coords="17,313,59,725,47,182,33,11,61" target="#b63">Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie's (2003)</ref> model were utilized: data reduction, data display, data transformation, data correlation, data comparison, and data integration.</p></div>

It can be seen from this table that by far the most frequent mixed methods sampling design contained in the set of selected investigations was concurrent design using identical samples. With respect to time orientation, more studies utilized a mixed methods sampling design that was concurrent (66.1%) than sequential (33.9%).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative and Mixed Methods Phases</head><p>The majority of the researchers (93.4%) were clear in delineating the sample sizes used in the various phases of their investigations. In the remaining studies, the sample size was not stated clearly in the quantitative phase (2.5%), qualitative phase (5.0%), or both phases (6.6%). Overall, this picture was much more positive than that found for the mixed methods studies from the eld of school psychology examined by <ref type="bibr" coords="18,411,14,710,54,118,54,11,61;18,64,51,725,66,78,95,11,61" target="#b11">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao (2006)</ref>. These researchers found that in only 57.8% of the studies were the sample sizes of both the quantitative and qualitative phases specied clearly. Excluding identical samples, which, by denition utilize the same sample for both the quantitative and   qualitative phases, no relationship emerged between the discrepancy of the quantitative and qualitative sample sizes and (a) the time orientation of the components (i.e., concurrent vs. sequential) and (b) whether the sampling design utilized parallel, nested, or multilevel sampling.</p><p>With respect to the random sampling scheme, only 14.9% of the studies involved random sampling in one or both phases. In contrast, the vast majority (91.7%) involved some form of purposive sampling in one or both phases of the study. 9 Although due to the lack of sufcient information provided, it was not always clear which of the 19 purposive sampling schemes identied by <ref type="bibr" coords="20,208,66,361,90,165,15,11,61" target="#b62">Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007)</ref> were utilized, it appeared that convenient sampling and criterion sampling represented the most common purposive schemes. Of the 8.3% of studies that utilized random sampling, exactly one half utilized some form of an identical sampling scheme (i.e., either concurrent identical sampling or sequential identical sampling). Table <ref type="table" coords="20,283,15,422,54,6,41,11,61" target="#tab_4">5</ref> presents the overall prevalence of sampling schemes used (i.e., purposive vs. random) for the quantitative and qualitative phases pertaining to the 121 articles.</p><p>Regardless of the size of the sample or of the discrepancy between the size of the samples in the quantitative and qualitative phases, the majority of researchers made metainferences <ref type="bibr" coords="20,121,15,498,33,159,94,11,61" target="#b79">(Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003b)</ref>, in which both sets of inferences are combined into a coherent whole. Moreover, the majority of these researchers tended to make some type of statistical generalization, rather than making analytic generalizations or case-to-case transfers. Specically, 58.7% of the articles made some type of statistical generalizationwhose justication depended, to a large degree, on the sampling scheme, sample size, and/ or sampling design used. The more the statistical generalization made was compatible with these sampling elements, the higher the level of interpretive consistency, and vice versa. For example, an article contained statistical generalizations that were justied (i.e., interpretative consistency) if the set of ndings being generalized (i.e., quantitative vs. qualitative phase[s]) stemmed from a large sample. Interpretive consistency was even higher if the sample was random in addition to being large. The level of interpretive consistency across the 121 articles lay on a continuum from interpretive inconsistent to interpretive consistent. <ref type="bibr" coords="20,78,49,695,44,123,22,11,61" target="#b29">Harwood et al.'s (2003)</ref> study provides an excellent example of an article that had high interpretive consistency. These researchers examined how communities, neighborhoods, and stores affect retail pricing and the promotion of beer. Using a multistage, random sampling procedure, the researchers randomly selected 2,024 retail stores from 160 communities. Each store was unobtrusively observed by trained eld staff teams who collected information on alcohol process, product placement, extent of related advertising and promotions, and type of size of the store. Using hierarchical regression models and mixed methods data analysis techniques, the researchers found that community, neighborhood, and store characteristics predict beer price, although only community and store characteristics predicted beer promotions. The researchers concluded that ''the ndings of this study conrm that beer promotion and pricing vary systematically by some characteristics of communities, neighborhoods and stores'' (p. 726). Whereas this clearly represents a statistical generalization, involving inferences that go far beyond the underlying sample, it could be argued that the use of a sample that was large and random justied such a generalization-although the researchers might have tempered their ndings by using words such as appears, may, might, or perhaps-bearing in mind the several limitations that the researchers wisely noted such as the predominance of White or less integrated neighborhoods in the sample. Notwithstanding, the meta-inferences made by the researchers appear to indicate interpretive consistency (cf. Type 1 sampling design in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="21,501,40,285,88,6,41,11,61" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Quadrant 4 in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="21,174,91,301,02,4,56,11,61" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Disturbingly, of the 54 studies that included a quantitative and/or a qualitative phase involving a sample of 30 or less participants, 53.7% contained meta-inferences that represented inappropriate statistical generalizations-leading to interpretive inconsistency. <ref type="bibr" coords="21,66,17,361,68,131,05,11,61" target="#b38">Kneebone et al.'s (2003)</ref> article provides such an example. These researchers examined the potential of an innovative, scenario-based technique that links a simulated patient with a computer-driven virtual reality (VR) training device for exible sigmoidoscopy (i.e., visual examination of the lower third of the colon in a search for a nonmalignant growth or tumor). This device provides a safe yet realistic quasi-clinical setting for learners to carry out the procedure while interacting with the ''patient.'' Communication skills are assessed by simulated patients, and quantitative performance data relating to the technique are produced automatically by the VR simulator. Kneebone et al. described their investigation as a pilot study that took place within a nurse practitioner endoscopy course. Seven nurses were selected for the study using a concurrent design with identical samples for both quantitative and qualitative components of the investigation. Qualitative (observation and interviews) and quantitative (communication rating scales and a range of computergenerated output measures from the VR simulator) data were collected. The participants found the procedure to provide a powerful and effective learning experience. However, they all experienced high levels of anxiety. Simulated patients identied strengths in participants' communication skills, alongside areas for development. The simulator-based approach led to an improvement in the quantitative performance measures. Based on the ndings pertaining to seven nurses, and despite stating that ''we recognise the limitations of our sample size'' (p. 57), the researchers made the following unjustied statistical generalization: ''Scenario-based training provides a powerful learning experience, allowing participants to build their technical expertise and apply it within a holistic clinical context without the risk of causing harm' <ref type="bibr" coords="21,239,85,679,95,43,27,11,61">' (p. 50)</ref>. This meta-inference, which represented interpretive inconsistency (cf. Type 4 sampling design in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="21,375,38,695,15,6,41,11,61" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Quadrant 4 in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="21,517,43,695,15,4,63,11,61" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), would have been more justied if the authors had used the phrase ''scenario-based training can provide a powerful learning experience'' rather than ''scenario-based training provides a powerful learning experience.'' Or more appropriately, the authors could have stated that ''the scenario-based training provides a powerful learning experience for the seven nurses.'' Thus, a subtle change in the phrasing of the meta-inference or the adding of specic information pertaining to the study's sample would have conveyed a more warranted interpretation of the study's ndings.</p><p>Interestingly, several researchers made interpretive inconsistent meta-inferences despite acknowledging the limitations of their study. For instance, dela <ref type="bibr" coords="22,400,52,149,47,129,14,11,61;22,64,50,164,59,32,05,11,61" target="#b20">Cruz, Brehm, and Harris (2004)</ref>, who examined focus group tapes and transcripts and three completed quantitative measures (i.e., demographic form, measure of attitudes toward homelessness, and an attendance form) of 15 family nurse practitioners students, acknowledged that ''because the sample size was small (n ¼ 15), the results of the study can apply only to this sample and cannot be generalized' <ref type="bibr" coords="22,206,47,225,22,50,63,11,61">' (p. 553)</ref>. Despite this statement, the researchers concluded that ''a required clinical experience in an HOC [homeless outreach clinic]-as a servicetraining strategy-signicantly changes attitudes toward homeless people and instills in the students social responsibility for the case of one of the fast-growing, underserved, and misunderstood segments of our society' <ref type="bibr" coords="22,267,37,285,88,46,52,11,61">' (p. 553)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This investigation has replicated and extended the initial study in the area of sampling conducted by <ref type="bibr" coords="22,139,48,376,76,204,67,11,61" target="#b11">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao (2006)</ref>, who used mixed methods techniques to examine the types of sampling designs, sampling schemes, and sample sizes used by mixed methods researchers. That is, as was undertaken in the initial study, this research has involved the use of mixed methods techniques to study the mixed methods literature. However, whereas Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao focused on studies published in school psychology journals (N ¼ 42) in which both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used (typically not explicitly labeled as mixed methods research by the investigators), the current study was much broader in scope, examining studies across nine elds (N ¼ 121) that the respective researchers actually labeled as using mixed methods research. Indeed, the 121 studies examined in the present investigation represent the entire population of mixed methods studies-at the time of writing.</p><p>A sequential design utilizing identical samples was used to classify this population of mixed methods studies on a two-dimensional model in which sampling designs were grouped according to time orientation of study's components and relationship of the qualitative and quantitative samples. A quantitative analysis of 121 studies representing nine elds revealed that a concurrent design using identical samples was the most frequent mixed methods sampling design. Furthermore, twice as many studies utilized a mixed methods sampling design that was concurrent than sequential. Also, identical sampling designs were the most prevalent. These ndings are in direct contrast with the results of <ref type="bibr" coords="22,64,51,664,84,199,84,11,61" target="#b11">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao (2006)</ref>, who found that (a) a sequential design using multilevel samples was the most frequent mixed methods sampling design, (b) twice as many studies utilized a mixed methods sampling design that was sequential than concurrent, and (c) multilevel sampling designs were the most prevalent. However, these discrepancies likely underscore the difference in the elds examined in the two studies. As noted earlier, whereas in the initial study the researchers analyzed school psychology mixed methods studies, the current investigation cast a much wider net by examining articles from nine elds. The discrepancy in the distribution of sampling designs could reect the differences in intentionality to conduct mixed methods research, with all the studies examined in the current investigation deliberately being set up as mixed methods investigations. The difference in the distribution of sampling designs also could be indicative of the types of research goals, objectives, rationale of the study, rationale for mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches, purpose of the study, and/or purpose for mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches that distinguish school psychology research from research underlying other elds and disciplines.</p><p>The eld examined that was closest to the eld of school psychology, in terms of discipline or orientation, was psychology. From Table <ref type="table" coords="23,329,00,225,22,4,81,11,61" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, it can be seen that the vast majority (72.7%) of articles classied as belonging to the eld of psychology utilized concurrent sampling designs. These articles tended to represent clinical psychology, counseling psychology, and social psychology. It is possible that these branches of psychology (i.e., clinical psychology, counseling psychology) have different rationales for mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches than does the eld of school psychology, leading to different emphases on sampling designs. For example, in <ref type="bibr" coords="23,319,22,316,15,212,13,11,61" target="#b11">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao's (2006)</ref> initial inquiry, the rationale that the researchers used for mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches tended to be either instrument delity (i.e., quantitative or qualitative approaches used by the researcher to develop new instruments or maximize the appropriateness and/or utility of new or existing instruments used in the study <ref type="bibr" coords="23,424,04,376,81,100,68,11,61;23,66,16,392,01,108,45,11,61" target="#b12">[Collins, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Sutton, 2006]</ref>) or treatment integrity (i.e., assessing the delity of interventions, treatments, or programs; <ref type="bibr" coords="23,193,85,407,14,199,74,11,61" target="#b12">Collins, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Sutton, 2006)</ref>. In particular, using qualitative techniques (e.g., interviews, observations) to develop an instrument (i.e., instrument delity) or to collect baseline data (i.e., treatment integrity) tends to lead to sequential designs. In contrast, the rationale of a signicant proportion of the studies examined in the present investigation was signicance enhancement (i.e., enhancing researchers' interpretations of data <ref type="bibr" coords="23,161,67,482,93,208,57,11,61" target="#b12">[Collins, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Sutton, 2006]</ref>). That the majority of studies (54.8%) conducted in the eld of school psychology tended to utilize multilevel sampling designs has intuitive appeal because many school psychology researchers tend to sample both students (typically for the quantitative phase) and their school psychologists, teachers, and/or parents (typically for the qualitative stage).</p><p>Sampling is even more complex in the mixed methods research process because the meta-inferences that stem from these studies involve combining inferences from the quantitative and qualitative phases of the study that are highly dependent on the sampling scheme and sample size used. Moreover, the quantitative and qualitative components bring into the mixed methods investigation their own challenges of representation, legitimation, integration, and politics. As noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="23,308,84,634,52,182,21,11,61">Onwuegbuzie and Collins (in press</ref>), these combined challenges are likely to yield an additive effect or even a multiplicative effect that adversely impacts the quality of meta-inferences made.</p><p>In this study, the majority of researchers (i.e., 58.7%) made statistical generalizations. Unfortunately, in many instances (i.e., 53.7% of studies with small samples in at least one phase), such statistical generalizations were not sufciently warranted-culminating in interpretive inconsistency and contributing to all four crises, namely, representation, legitimation, integration, and politics. The crisis of representation was exacerbated in these studies because the meta-inferences did not adequately represent the ndings stemming from the quantitative and/or qualitative phases of these investigations. That is, the metainferences made in these inquiries have inadequate external validity (i.e., the extent to which the ndings of a study can be generalized across different populations of persons, settings, contexts, and times <ref type="bibr" coords="24,164,13,134,27,154,67,11,61" target="#b33">[Johnson &amp; Christensen, 2004]</ref>) and/or external credibility (i.e., conrmability and transferability of ndings and conclusions <ref type="bibr" coords="24,337,39,149,47,81,62,11,61" target="#b43">[Maxwell, 1992]</ref>). The crisis of legitimation was intensied in these investigations because the meta-inferences did not stem directly from the underlying sample of units <ref type="bibr" coords="24,294,26,179,71,99,39,11,61">(Curtis et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="24,397,23,179,71,103,48,11,61" target="#b36">Kemper et al., 2003)</ref>. The crisis of integration was made worse in these inquiries because the meta-inferences did not arise from a Type 1 mixed methods sampling scheme (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="24,407,40,210,03,4,57,11,61" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Finally, the crisis of politics was exacerbated in these studies because the meta-inferences leave these studies open for criticism by the consumers of these studies, including stakeholders and policy makers.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it is not clear the extent to which interpretive consistency may differ as a function of the rationale and purpose guiding the research design within a specic discipline. Subsequently, more research is needed using a larger sample of mixed methods studies to determine why and how different elds and disciplines are mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches. A second limitation of this investigation is that the interpretation of the researchers' meta-inferences may be inuenced by the word choice used by the researcher(s) when interpreting the ndings. Specically, semantics involved in the researchers' choice of words when interpreting results may lead to the appearance of overgeneralization even in cases when the researchers' goal was not to make generalizations beyond the underlying sample. Unfortunately, it was beyond the scope of the present investigation to determine the researchers' intentionality to generalize. At best, we could only ascertain whether the statement made suggested or implied overgeneralization. Future studies should address the extent to which statements that suggest or imply overgeneralization reect the researchers' intentions.</p><p>Notwithstanding, it should be noted that all 42 studies in Collins, Onwuegbuzie, and Jiao's (2006) initial investigation and all 121 studies in the present inquiry could be classi-ed into one of the eight mixed methods sampling designs provides incremental validity to <ref type="bibr" coords="24,81,43,528,45,203,59,11,61">Onwuegbuzie and Collins's (in press</ref>) two-dimensional sampling design modelalthough we recognize that this model might not be applicable for classifying more complex mixed methods sampling designs (cf. Note 5). However, although these two studies have shown the utility of Onwuegbuzie and Collins's model for classifying and understanding the sampling decisions made by researchers in mixed methods studies, the greatest appeal of this model is that it can help researchers to identify a rigorous sampling design for their mixed methods studies, which is a much more complex process than is the case for monomethod studies. In particular, this model can be used to guide sampling decisions made by the researcher, such as selecting a sampling scheme (e.g., random vs. purposive), selecting an appropriate sample size for the quantitative and qualitative phases of the study to enable appropriate generalizations and inferences, and identifying the relationship of the samples <ref type="bibr" coords="24,110,41,695,15,222,76,11,61">(i.e., identical, parallel, nested, multilevel)</ref> relative to the study's design. Using our model provides a framework for making these decisions explicit and promotes interpretive consistency between the interpretations made in mixed methods studies and the sampling design used, as well as the other components that characterize the formulation (i.e., goal, objective, purpose, rationale, and research question), planning (i.e., research design), and implementation (i.e., data collection, analysis, legitimation, and interpretation) stages of the mixed methods research process. Another positive aspect of this model is that it does not have a bias toward either quantitative or qualitative approaches, allowing samples to be selected for both phases methodically and rigorously. Thus, we hope that researchers from the social and behavioral sciences and beyond consider using this sampling design model so that they can design their mixed methods studies in a manner that addresses the challenges of representation, legitimation, integration, and politics.</p></div>

For a useful alternative typology of sampling schemes, we refer you to <ref type="bibr" coords="25,391,11,325,36,94,43,9,50" target="#b81">Teddlie and Yu (2007)</ref>, who subdivided sampling schemes into the following four types: probability sampling, purposive sampling, convenience sampling, and mixed methods sampling. In our typology, we included convenience sampling and mixed methods sampling under the label of purposive sampling schemes, which is consistent with many authors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="25,90,11,376,63,52,46,9,50" target="#b30">Hood, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="25,145,18,376,63,110,92,9,50" target="#b47">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="25,258,70,376,63,126,77,9,50" target="#b62">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Leech, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="25,388,14,376,63,54,69,9,50" target="#b65">Patton, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>3. Many authors link sampling schemes with the paradigm. In particular, they associate random sampling schemes with quantitative research designs and purposive schemes with qualitative research designs. However, we think that this dichotomy is problematic for several reasons. First, as noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="25,408,70,415,11,122,68,9,50;25,66,16,427,91,19,62,9,50">Onwuegbuzie and Collins (in press</ref>), choice of sampling scheme (i.e., random vs. purposive) should be based on the type of generalization of interest (i.e., statistical vs. analytic). Thus, although not very common, qualitative research can involve random sampling. Similarly, quantitative research can involve purposive sampling-as is the case in the vast majority of quantitative studies <ref type="bibr" coords="25,160,43,466,39,103,53,9,50" target="#b73">(Shaver &amp; Norton, 1980a</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="25,263,96,466,39,34,66,9,50" target="#b74">, 1980b)</ref>. Thus, we believe that the dichotomy between research paradigm and sampling scheme is false. For a lengthier discussion of this false dichotomy, we refer the readers to <ref type="bibr" coords="25,76,90,492,06,137,34,9,50" target="#b61">Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2005b)</ref>.</p><p>4. It should be noted that the issue of sample size in qualitative research is a controversial one. However, as noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="25,121,82,517,66,84,21,9,50" target="#b66">Sandelowski (1995)</ref>, a general rule is that sample sizes in qualitative research should not be too small that it is difcult to obtain data saturation, theoretical saturation, or informational redundancy. At the same time, the sample should not be so large that it is difcult to undertake a deep, case-oriented analysis. <ref type="bibr" coords="25,66,16,556,14,95,40,9,50" target="#b81">Teddlie and Yu (2007)</ref> referred to this balancing act in qualitative sampling as the representativeness/saturation trade-off.</p><p>5. Although <ref type="bibr" coords="25,133,56,581,82,154,70,9,50">Onwuegbuzie and Collins's (in press</ref>) typology is comprehensive, representing a large proportion of mixed methods sampling designs, it is not exhaustive. In particular, this typology does not incorporate mixed methods studies in which the quantitative and/or the qualitative phases involve two or more different sampling schemes (e.g., a qualitative phase involving individual interviews and focus groups that necessitate two different sampling schemes and a quantitative phase involving the administration of a survey and an achievement test that necessitate two different sampling schemes). In other words, Onwuegbuzie and Collins's typology does not incorporate mixed methods studies wherein the quantitative and/or the qualitative phases involve mixed purposeful, multistage purposeful, or random multistage purposeful sampling schemes (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="25,467,47,671,57,3,73,9,50" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>6. This set of 496 articles revealed that the rst study in which the term mixed methods was used appeared in 1972 <ref type="bibr" coords="25,101,58,697,24,96,30,9,50" target="#b64">(Parkhurst et al., 1972)</ref>. However, this study was eliminated in the next round because it represented an unpublished study (i.e., paper presentation).</p><p>7. We decided to focus only on published studies that had been peer-reviewed because we believed that they were more likely to have been grounded in mixed methods research due to undergoing a peer-review process.</p><p>8. It should be noted that all seven articles that were eliminated at this stage contained the term mixed method(s) at least once. However, no evidence was provided that suggested the researcher(s) has used mixed methods approaches. In most cases, these articles had been selected because they had contained the term mixed method or its variant in the literature review section. 9. The proportion of studies involving random sampling in one or both phases (i.e., 14.9%) and the proportion of studies involving some form of purposive sampling in one or both phases of the study (i.e., 91.7%) do not sum to 100% because a few studies contained a phase that involved both random sampling and purposive sampling.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="9,275,74,88,78,46,01,11,50;9,122,02,103,90,353,50,11,50;9,118,91,119,10,359,73,11,50;9,105,05,148,29,387,58,299,95"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Two-Dimensional Matrix Indicating Sampling Designs That Can Yield Statistical Generalizations That Are Interpretive Consistent</figDesc><graphic coords="9,105,05,148,29,387,58,299,95" type="bitmap" /></figure>
